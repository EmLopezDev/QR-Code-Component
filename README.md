## My process

-   Focused first on using semantic html
-   Then made sure to follow the design in figma to style the component according to that design

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS with custom variables
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

One thing I am starting to do more of is taking the approach a step at a time. Meaning first focusing on getting the HTML right before even adding CSS. Also although very little color was used, I am making it a habit to do CSS variable to make it easier for any future modifications. Finally using rem instead of px for font sizing.

### Continued development

I am going to continue on working on creating layouts that match the design which will make me better at reading Figma designs.
